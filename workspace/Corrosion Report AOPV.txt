EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This corrosion and structural steel condition assessment report summarizes findings from
the 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024 inspection cycles conducted on Harry DeWolf-class Arctic Offshore Patrol Vessels:
• AOPV HARRY DEWOLF (2021, 2022, 2023, 2024)
• AOPV MARGARET BROOKE (2022, 2023, 2024)

Objectives:
• Identify hull corrosion and pitting progression
• Evaluate topside corrosion, coating performance, and mechanical damage
• Assess cathodic protection (sacrificial anodes + bonding systems)
• Perform steel thickness measurements to monitor structural integrity
• Review effects of Arctic operations on corrosion acceleration

Recommended Maintenance Priority:
1. Hull coating repairs during 2025 dry docking
2. Bilge radius pitting monitoring (Margaret Brooke)
3. Replacement of depleted sacrificial anodes (Harry DeWolf bow region)
4. Repairs to exposed fittings on 02 & 03 decks (both ships)

Risk Assessment: LOW for 2024 deployment — conditional on recommended maintenance.

CHAPTER 1 — INSPECTION BACKGROUND

1.1 Ship Class & Operating Profile
The Harry DeWolf-class operates in:
• Arctic waters (ice exposure)
• North Atlantic saltwater
• Brackish & freeze-thaw regions

1.2 Corrosion Threat Overview
Primary drivers:
• Abrasion from ice contact
• Mechanical coating damage during operations
• Saltwater immersion
• Temperature cycling (–35°C to +20°C)
• High humidity in internal tanks

CHAPTER 2 — HULL CORROSION OBSERVATIONS

2.1 Summary of Hull Zones Inspected:
Zone A: Forward Ice Belt  
Zone B: Midships Shell Plating  
Zone C: Stern & Propulsor Region  
Zone D: Bilge Radius  
Zone E: Boot Top Coating Zone  

Findings highlight progression in key corrosion hotspots.

--- INSPECTION YEAR: 2021 (Harry DeWolf) ---

Zone A (Forward Ice Belt)
• Coating breakdown due to repeated ice impacts  
• Localized rust streaking along weld seams  

Zone B
• Minor pitting beginning near midships port side

Zone D
• Bilge area shows early underfilm corrosion

Steel thickness min: 11.8 mm (baseline design 12.0 mm)

Recommended Work:
• Preventive maintenance during next docking

--- INSPECTION YEAR: 2022 (Both Ships) ---

Zone A
• Hull shell plating coating abrasion increased on both vessels
• Rust deposits accumulating at waterline

Zone C
• Stern area shows coating removal around propulsor mounts

Zone D (Margaret Brooke)
• Localized pits measuring 0.8–1.4 mm deep

Steel thickness min (MB): 11.6 mm  
Steel thickness min (HDW): 11.7 mm

--- INSPECTION YEAR: 2023 (Both Ships) ---

New Findings:
• Pitting corrosion spread into bilge radius → HDW & MB
• Coating blistering detected along ice belt region

Risk Trend: Slight upward progression due to harsh Arctic deployments

--- INSPECTION YEAR: 2024 (Both Ships) ---

Zone B
• Underfilm corrosion detected along the lower shell plating

Zone D (Margaret Brooke)
• Deepest pit observed: 2.0 mm
• Still within allowable tolerance, but trending upward

Steel thickness min (2024):
• Harry DeWolf: 11.6 mm
• Margaret Brooke: 11.5 mm

Conclusion: Continue inspections annually.

CHAPTER 3 — TOPSIDE CORROSION

3.1 Observed Hotspots
• Handrails — 02 deck (coating chipped)
• Boat handling cranes — mechanical paint damage
• Mast & exposed fittings — UV + impact wear
• Scupper openings — rust staining around penetrations  

Maintenance Planner Notes:
Periodic coating touch-ups required every year when dockside.

In 2024, both ships:
• 02–03 deck ladders exhibited visible rust at attachment welds

---

CHAPTER 4 — CATHODIC PROTECTION (SACRIFICIAL ANODES)

4.1 Bow Region Anode Condition  
Harry DeWolf:
• 3 anodes >75% material loss (replace)  
• Bow sees increased brackish water exposure

Margaret Brooke:
• Normal consumption (<50%)  

4.2 Stern Region Bonding Verification
Electrical continuity test confirms
• Full bonding intact on both ships

Recommendation:
Replace bow anodes on HDW during 2025 docking.

---

CHAPTER 5 — COATING SYSTEM PERFORMANCE

Performance Rating Scale (1–5)
1 = Excellent
5 = Severe breakdown requiring immediate repair

2023–2024 Summary:
• Hull Ice Belt: 3 (abrasion-driven damage)
• Shell Plating: 2–3 range
• Topside Fittings: 3–4 (mechanical impacts)

Coating Type: Arctic-capable epoxy / polyurethane

Repairs required: spot blasting & recoating

---

CHAPTER 6 — DRY DOCK INSPECTION RESULTS

Dock Availability:
• HDW: 2021, 2023
• MB: 2022, 2024

Structural steel remained within design allowances.

Notable Findings in Dry Dock:
• Waterline corrosion consistently under load marks
• Minor weld seam corrosion throughout both hulls

Monitoring action: Continue annual survey intervals.

---

CHAPTER 7 — INTERNAL TANKS CORROSION

Tanks inspected:
• Fuel storage
• Fresh water tanks
• Ballast tanks

Observations:
• Condensation driving micro-pitting in upper tank regions  
• Coating requires spot repair in ballast tanks of HDW

---

CHAPTER 8 — STEEL THICKNESS MEASUREMENTS (UTM SURVEY)

Min thickness trends (mm):

Year | HDW | MB
---- | ---- | ----
2021 | 11.8 | —
2022 | 11.7 | 11.6
2023 | 11.7 | 11.6
2024 | 11.6 | 11.5

Design baseline: 12.0 mm  
→ Margin remains sufficient for operation until 2030–2031

CHAPTER 9 — CORROSION ACCELERATION STUDY IN ARCTIC CONDITIONS

Driving factors analyzed:
• Salinity variation
• Ice abrasion cycles
• Thermal gradients
• Coating micro-cracking
• Increased oxygen concentration in cold water

Conclusion:
Arctic operations increase coating wear rate by approx. 30–40%.

---

CHAPTER 10 — RECOMMENDATIONS & MAINTENANCE PRIORITIES

2025 Dry Dock Action Items:
• Replace sacrificial anodes (HDW bow)
• Perform spot recoating of ice belt zones
• Expand pitting monitoring program (MB bilge radius)

Long-Term Strategy:
• Enhanced coatings in bow region
• Frequent topside repairs after boat operations
• Maintain annual corrosion surveys for both vessels
