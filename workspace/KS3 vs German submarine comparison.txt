Date: December 2025

Executive Summary

The Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) faces a strategic inflection point with the impending retirement of its four Victoria‑class submarines in the mid‑2030s. Canada’s Canadian Patrol Submarine Project (CPSP) aims to acquire up to 12 next‑generation conventionally powered submarines with capabilities including under‑ice operations, extended range/endurance, blue‑water deployment, and effective integration with NATO and allied forces. Two primary contenders have emerged:

KSS‑III (South Korea / Hanwha Ocean)

German Type 212CD (Thyssenkrupp Marine Systems)

This report argues that the KSS‑III platform presents a superior long‑term option for the RCN due to its operational flexibility, weapons capacity, endurance, modernization potential, crew habitability, and delivery schedule, when aligned with Canada’s unique strategic requirements.

1. Introduction

Canada’s submarine capability is central to its ability to exert maritime presence, conduct anti‑submarine and anti‑surface warfare, and protect Arctic sovereignty. The current Victoria‑class submarines, acquired second‑hand from the United Kingdom, have been operational since the early 2000s and are approaching their planned end‑of‑service life in the mid‑2030s. 
Canada

In response, the Canadian Patrol Submarine Project (CPSP) was initiated to procure a modern fleet of up to 12 submarines with features including:

Under‑ice operation capability

Extended submerged endurance

Blue‑water deployment capacity

Advanced weapon systems

Integration with allied forces, including NATO

The RCN has narrowed the field to options from South Korea (KSS‑III) and Germany/Norway (Type 212CD).

2. Strategic & Operational Requirements

Canada’s geography imposes unique operational demands:

Arctic sovereignty and year‑round under‑ice patrols

Long‑range power projection across the North Atlantic and Pacific

NATO missions and coalition operations

Intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR)

Anti‑surface and anti‑submarine warfare

Additionally, Canada seeks to avoid capability gaps between Victoria‑class retirement and new submarine delivery, and desires industrial and economic benefits domestically through technology transfer and sustainment agreements.

3. Canada’s Current Submarine Capability

The Victoria‑class submarines are diesel‑electric hunter‑killer submarines originally built as the British Upholder class. They displace around 2,200 t (~2,455 t submerged), have a submerged speed of ~20 kn, and are equipped with heavyweight torpedoes. 
Wikipedia

While they have served for over two decades, limited endurance, aging systems, and maintenance challenges have increasingly constrained operational availability. This underscores the necessity for an advanced, reliable successor platform.

4. Overview of Contender Designs
4.1 KSS‑III (Hanwha Ocean / Republic of Korea)

Displacement ~3,600 t

Lithium‑ion batteries with Air Independent Propulsion (AIP)

Designed for blue‑water operations and extended sustained missions

Capable of heavy torpedoes and submarine‑launched cruise missiles (SLCMs) via Vertical Launch System (VLS)

Already in active production and service with the Republic of Korea Navy

Delivery estimate: first unit ~2032; 4 by 2035; up to 12 by 2043 (if contracted in 2026) 
Canadian Defence Review

4.2 Type 212CD (Germany / Norway / TKMS)

Medium displacement design optimized for stealth and Arctic conditions

Fuel cell‑based AIP for low acoustic signature

Mature NATO user group with allied sustainment ecosystem

Proven submarine design lineage

Strong stealth and sensor integration capabilities

5. Technical Comparison: KSS‑III vs German Submarines
5.1 Hull Design & Arctic Performance

KSS‑III:

Larger hull offers superior space for crew comfort and extended deployment

Designed more for open‑ocean endurance than extreme under‑ice surfacing scenarios

Type 212CD:

Smaller hull is optimized for submerged stealth and maneuverability in shallow waters

Very low acoustic signature and exceptional under‑ice stealth posture

Assessment: While Type 212CD’s stealth shaping excels in chokepoints and littorals, the KSS‑III’s range and volume support strategic depth operations across Atlantic, Pacific, and Arctic zones. 
Michael J. Lalonde

5.2 Propulsion & Endurance

KSS‑III:

Lithium‑ion batteries + AIP result in long submerged endurance (>21 days)

Greater energy budget supports sustained missions away from home ports

Type 212CD:

Excellent AIP via hydrogen fuel cells with unmatched stealth

Slightly less range/endurance due to smaller capacity

Assessment: For a nation with vast oceans and distant patrol requirements, KSS‑III’s endurance advantage supports Canada’s expansive mission set. 
Canadian Defence Review

5.3 Weapons & Sensors

KSS‑III:

Built‑in Vertical Launch System (VLS) for land attack & anti‑ship cruise missiles

Heavy torpedo capacity

Type 212CD:

Focused on heavyweight torpedoes and limited future additional strike options

Sensor ecosystem tailored toward stealth and anti‑submarine missions

Assessment: KSS‑III’s VLS gives Canada broad strike capability and flexibility beyond traditional SSK roles — important for distant coalition tasks.

5.4 Automation & Crew Habitat

KSS‑III:

Larger internal volume allows enhancements in crew comfort and habitability

High automation reduces crew requirements and eases operational demands

Type 212CD:

Smaller crew with optimized operational design

Less internal volume for extended high‑habitat needs

Assessment: For long Pacific or Atlantic patrols, KSS‑III’s habitability supports sustained deployments efficiently.

5.5 Interoperability & Sustainment

KSS‑III:

Emerging user group; requires bilateral sustainment structures

Training and maintenance frameworks can be built into procurement

Type 212CD:

Mature NATO sustainment ecosystem and established supply chain

Assessment: Although Type 212CD has a sustainment edge, Canada can negotiate full technical data rights and in‑country support with KSS‑III contracts to achieve equivalent sustainment structures.

5.6 Delivery Schedule & Industrial Benefits

KSS‑III:

Already in production, enabling an accelerated delivery schedule with potential early Victoria‑class retirement cost savings. 
Breaking Defense

Type 212CD:

European production channels may experience backlog pressures.

Assessment: Timely delivery is critical for avoiding capability gaps, favoring a production‑ready option like KSS‑III.

6. Risk Assessment

KSS‑III Risks

New export platform status → integration risk

Sustainment ecosystem must be developed collaboratively

Type 212CD Risks

Smaller weapons payload profile for strategic deterrence

Less strike flexibility beyond anti‑sub and littoral roles

7. Strategic Recommendation

Based on the RCN’s requirements — under‑ice capability, extended range, strike options, sustained global deployment, crew sustainability, and timely delivery — the KSS‑III submarine design presents a superior value proposition. Its greater endurance, strike flexibility, and delivery schedule align more closely with Canada’s strategic imperatives. 
Michael J. Lalonde

8. Conclusion

Selecting the next generation of submarines is a historic decision for Canadian defence. While German designs offer excellent stealth and traditional submarine capabilities, KSS‑III provides a more adaptable and future‑ready platform that meets the RCN’s unique breadth of operational requirements and geopolitical commitments.
